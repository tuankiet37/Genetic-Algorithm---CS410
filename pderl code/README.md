#### To Run PDERL #### 

First, you will have to install all the dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
Additionally, for installing mujoco-py 2.0.2.2, follow the instructions on the [official github](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py). 

To run PDERL with proximal mutations and distillation-based crossover use:

```bash
python run_pderl.py -env=$ENV_NAME$ -distil -proximal_mut -mut_mag=$MUT_MAG$ -logdir=$LOG_DIR$
python run_pderl.py -env=Walker2d-v2 -distil -proximal_mut -mut_mag=0.05 -logdir=result_walker

```

To evaluate and visualise a trained model in an environment use:

```bash
python play_pderl.py -env=$ENV_NAME$ -model_path=$MODEL_PATH$ -render 
```

Our code is largely based on the [code of Khadka and Tumer](https://github.com/ShawK91/erl_paper_nips18) and we would 
like to thank them for making their code publicly available. The proximal mutations code is also relying on 
the [safe mutations code](https://github.com/uber-research/safemutations) of Lehman et al. from Uber Research.
